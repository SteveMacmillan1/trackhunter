      <div id="answer-div-1" class="answer-div">
        <p>Start with a song you like and we'll give you similar song recommendations to check out.
        We'll never show you the same recommendation twice, and you can ban artists from
        appearing in your recommendations feed. Bookmark songs that you like as you go, then 
        <span class="underlined">export them directly to your Spotify account!</span></p>

      <p id="question2" class="question">Who is it intended for?</p>
      <div id="answer-div-2" class="answer-div">
        <p>Our primary goal is to help serious music curators find deep tracks with the genres and characteristics they want.
        But we also have search options to help users discover the bigger hits in genres they're still new to.</p>

      <div id="answer-div-3" class="answer-div">
        <p>No. We just filter songs from those artists out individually by the artist's Spotify ID.</p>

    <h3>Spotify API Deprecations</h3>

      <fa-icon 
        id="expand-icon-5" 
        class="expand-icon" 
        [icon]="icons['icon5']" 
        (click)="expandAnswer(5)">
      </fa-icon>
      <p id="question5" class="question">What happened?</p>
      <div id="answer-div-5" class="answer-div">
        <p>Spotify API deprecated its /recommendations endpoint in
          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api">November 2024</a>.
        This has unfortunately ended our music discovery use case for now but we may revive the project at some time
        (see "Future Plans" below).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <fa-icon 
        id="expand-icon-6" 
        class="expand-icon" 
        [icon]="icons['icon6']" 
        (click)="expandAnswer(6)">
      </fa-icon>
      <p id="question6" class="question">How does that affect things?</p>
      <div id="answer-div-6" class="answer-div">
        <p>TrackHunter now issues the same 50 song recommendations in a loop. They're loaded from a JSON file 
          that mimics a /recommendations response, so the site still handles and displays content dynamically
          as though it received that data from Spotify.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <fa-icon 
        id="expand-icon-7" 
        class="expand-icon" 
        [icon]="icons['icon7']" 
        (click)="expandAnswer(7)">
      </fa-icon>
      <p id="question7" class="question">So what does TrackHunter actually do now, then?</p>
      <div id="answer-div-7" class="answer-div">
        <p id="users-perspective-p">From a <span class="bold">user's perspective:</span></p> 
        <p>Unfortunately not much. TrackHunter doesn't have realistic use cases when forced to loop the same 50 recommended tracks.</p>
        <p id="devs-perspective-p">From a <span class="bold">developer's pespective:</span> 
        <p>It still filters songs that have already been viewed, still filters songs from banned artists, still fetches
          seed tracks directly from the Spotify API, still acquires permissions from Spotify user accounts through 
          OAuth 2.0, and still exports bookmarked tracks to a user's Spotify account. So it's still a full-stack 
          website with database CRUDing that interacts with a 3rd party API.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <fa-icon 
        id="expand-icon-8" 
        class="expand-icon" 
        [icon]="icons['icon8']" 
        (click)="expandAnswer(8)">
      </fa-icon>
      <p id="question8" class="question">Any future plans for TrackHunter?</p>
      <div id="answer-div-8" class="answer-div">
        <p>We'd like to implement another song recommendation API service to the backend. The goal would be to make TrackHunter 
          platform-agnostic by using songs' universal ISRC IDs. That way we could export a user's bookmarked songs to any platform 
          that could support importing. We've checked out Deezer, last.fm, and other similar APIs for song recommendations but so far 
          haven't found something that'll quite work at this time.</p>
